## 1. Language Translator
This Python project translates English words to Spanish and French. You type in the English word, click the Translate button and the translated Spanish and French words are displayed. A csv file has the English, French and Spanish words. If the word is not in the csv file, an error message will be displayed. 

The project uses the Remi gui library to display the APP.
